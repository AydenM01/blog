Netlify is cool

So ended up deploying this site with Netlify instead of Github Pages, also registered my custom DNS and got it to be HTTPS, which is nice.

I have never been good at DevOps stuff, so I obviously had to fix some errors during this deployment. I learned how bundler and Gemfiles work, and it seems like a cool dependency management schema. I also successfully configured Netlify to auto-deploy the repo whenever the master branch is updated on Github, so the live site will always be up-to-date.

Update with school:
I decided to make a last minute change to my threads, which will have me take more courses related to databases, networking, and internet applications. I hope these courses will help me become a better full stack / web developer, as I feel like they are a bit more relevant to my career than Deep Learning / Robotics would be.

I am excited for what the future holds!
