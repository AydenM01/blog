Hello, world

This is the first post of this blog. Expect no structure or consistency; this is just a site where I can log my thoughts spontaneously, almost like a public diary.

I was too lazy to make a super fancy and responsive web app, so I plan just to keep this as a static Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages. This is using the 'Kasper' theme, which I think looks nice and functions well for a simple blog.

This year seems to be the end of a plateau in terms of programming. I can feel a sense of passion working up inside me, as well as an intense drive to learn.

One thing that seems interesting to me now is the potential for Javascript performance improvements using web assembly, and how you can use Rust to compile into wasm and directly export your functions as ECMA modules. In my internship next summer, it will be interesting to ask if there are any major Javascript performance bottlenecks, and see how drastic the web assembly performance improvements are. At first glace the syntax looks a little ugly in my opinion, but expected considering the low-level implications of the language.

In other news, I attended my first Hackathon and won a prize. I was very lucky with how my team turned out considering we were complete strangers the day of the event. I also just landed my first-choice internship after a lot of perseverance through the application process. I learned sometimes you have to really push for what you want in order for it to manifest into reality.
